# Google+ application for macOS

## Description

This is an unofficial site-wrapper application for macOS that created for Google Plus social network and support notification badge for unread messages. The application is built with [Nativefier](https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier) but contains my script for notification badge.

The script also may work with other websites that have the Google notification counter like [Google Hangouts](hangouts.google.com). 

## Installation
